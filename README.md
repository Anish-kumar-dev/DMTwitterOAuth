# DMTwitterOAuth

An Objective-C library made using blocks implementing OAuth protocol plus an example iOS (iPhone) app demonstrating its use.

First original work by Jaanus Kase

## How to get started

1. Register your app with Twitter at http://dev.twitter.com/apps
1. Get the DMTwitterOAuth source.
1. Register your app scheme and implement iOS's handle URL delegate (see DMTwitter.h for a complete doc)
1. Edit DMTwitter.h with your consumer key and secret that Twitter gives you
1. Compile and run our example.
1. (You need to drag files under 'DMTwitterOAuth Library' XCode group folder,register a custom scheme URL and handle openURL app delegate method in order to use this library in your project)

I've tested it under XCode 4.1 and iOS 5.1 both on device and simulator.
